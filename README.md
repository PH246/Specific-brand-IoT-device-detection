Specific brand IoT device detection

     In the present, the used of IoT-based devices has been increasing. In environments where there are many connected IoT devices, they can strain the networks as they generate a significant amount of data and traffic which can impact network performance if they were not properly managed. Furthermore, in important networks, IoT devices should come from the reliable sources to maintain the integrity of network traffic. However, many citizens may not follow the regulation and instead using devices from unreliable sources.

     Machine learning has become a popular choice for IoT device detection due to its ability to manage complex and dynamic data patterns effectively. It offers enhanced accuracy and efficiency by leveraging sophisticated algorithms to accurately classify devices and detect the differences. Machine learning models are scalable and adaptable, easily updated to incorporate new data and trends, ensuring relevance in evolving IoT environments.
